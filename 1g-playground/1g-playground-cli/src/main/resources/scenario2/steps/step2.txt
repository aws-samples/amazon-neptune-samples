The 1G data model consists of so-called statements, simple nodes, and
graphs. We call these 3 building blocks 1g elements. With these,
any LPG or RDF data can be represented.

- Statements: statements in 1G come in 3 different forms:
    - Relationship statements: These statements signify a relation
    between 2 other elements with an accompanying predicate.
    RDF statements with a resource in object position, and edges
    in LPG are represented in 1G as such statements.

    - Property statements: These statements allow elements to carry
    named values. RDF statements with a literal in object position, and
    properties on vertices and edges in LPG are represented in 1G using such
    statements.

    - Membership statements: These statements specify graph membership of
     relationship and property statements. This allows graph membership of
     RDF statements to be modeled this way.
