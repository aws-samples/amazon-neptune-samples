Finally, there are simple nodes and graphs:

- Simple nodes: These represent basic elements from LPG or RDF.
  This includes: IRIs and Blank Nodes from RDF, and vertices
  from LPG.

- Graphs: These are similar to RDF Graphs. They appear in
  membership statements, but can also appear in
  relationship or property statements.
