As previously mentioned, data loaded into the tool gets
converted into the OneGraph(1G) data format. OneGraph is an overarching
data model for both RDF data and property graphs(LPG). Any RDF or LPG
data can be converted into OneGraph without loss of information.

Although conversion to 1G from RDF or LPG is always lossless, not every 1G
data set can be converted without loss of information in the opposite
direction. We will explore this in more detail in scenario 4.
