As you can see, the RDF data set and property graph are now
both contained within the same OneGraph data set. The property names and
labels from the property graph are prefixed by a default IRI, we will
explore this in more detail in scenario 5.

Finally, let's use the \u001b[1mview -t og\u001b[0m command to examine the data
in the OneGraph serialization format. This format will make it
easier to interpret the data.
