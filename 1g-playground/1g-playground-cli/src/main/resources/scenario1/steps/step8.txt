To achieve interoperability between RDF and LPG data, all data loaded
into to the tool is converted into the overarching OneGraph data model.

Hence, the property graph we just loaded is not represented as a property
graph internally. When the \u001b[1mview\u001b[0m command is run, the data is converted
from the internal OneGraph representation to the specified RDF or LPG
format on the fly.

This allows us to \u001b[1mview\u001b[0m the data currently loaded in an RDF format, even though
the data was originally loaded as a property graph. Let's run the following
command to view the current data in N-Quads:
