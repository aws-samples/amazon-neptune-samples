Recap: We have seen how to use the \u001b[1mload\u001b[0m, \u001b[1mview\u001b[0m and \u001b[1mclear-data\u001b[0m commands.

- The \u001b[1mload\u001b[0m command allows us to load RDF or property graph data into the tool,
  it is important to note that data loading is additive, this allows several
  datasets to be loaded on top of each other.
- The \u001b[1mview\u001b[0m command allows us to view what data is currently loaded.
- The \u001b[1mclear-data\u001b[0m command clears all data previously loaded.
