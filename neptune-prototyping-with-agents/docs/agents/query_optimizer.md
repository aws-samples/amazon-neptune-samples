# Query Optimization Agent

## Overview
The Query Optimization Agent generates multiple query variations, validates results for consistency, and provides performance analysis to identify the best implementation.

## Input
- Original openCypher query
- Optimization requirements
- Performance constraints
- Result validation criteria

## Output
- Multiple optimized query variations
- Performance ranking and analysis
- Result consistency validation
- Tradeoff analysis between implementations

## Usage
Provide a working openCypher query that needs optimization, and the agent will generate alternative implementations, test them against your Neptune cluster, and recommend the best approach.

## Features
- Multiple query variation generation
- Automated performance testing
- Result consistency validation
- Comprehensive tradeoff analysis
- Performance ranking with metrics
- Integration with Neptune MCP Server for validation
