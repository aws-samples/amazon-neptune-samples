# Data Pattern Generation Agent

## Overview
The Data Pattern Generation Agent simulates specific scenarios and edge cases by inserting targeted test data directly into Neptune via the MCP Server.

## Input
- Specific scenario requirements
- Pattern complexity parameters
- Target use case context

## Output
- Scenario-specific test data
- Direct Neptune cluster insertion
- Pattern documentation

## Usage
Define specific scenarios you want to test (e.g., complex money laundering patterns, fraud rings) and the agent will create realistic data patterns that match those scenarios.

## Features
- Scenario-based data generation
- Complex pattern simulation
- Edge case testing support
- Direct Neptune integration via MCP Server

## Example Use Cases
- Money laundering pattern simulation
- Fraud ring detection testing
- Network analysis edge cases
- Compliance scenario testing

## Costs
This agent generally costs between $1 USD and $1.50 USD per execution.  Each question may have an execution of this agent, leading to total costs of $3 USD to $4.50 USD for a standard 3 question workflow.
