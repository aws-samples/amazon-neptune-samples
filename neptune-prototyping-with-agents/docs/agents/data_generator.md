# Data Generation Agents

## Overview
The Data Generation Agents create thousands of nodes and edges with realistic data to populate your Neptune cluster based on the generated graph model.

## Input
- Graph model from Model Generator Agent
- Data volume requirements
- Realism and distribution parameters

## Output
- Realistic nodes and edges
- Direct integration with Neptune via MCP Server
- Populated graph ready for testing

## Usage
Provide the graph model and specify the scale of data needed. The agents will generate realistic test data and write it directly to your Neptune cluster using the Neptune MCP Server.

## Features
- Realistic data generation
- Configurable data volumes
- Direct Neptune cluster integration
- Maintains referential integrity

## Costs
The costs generated by this agent can vary widely based on the number of nodes, edges, and properties on the nodes and edges. To limit costs, review the graph schema to remove any nodes, edges, and properties you do not think are necessary for your use case.
As a high level estimate, you can assume each 100 edges generated will cost $1 USD and each 500 nodes generated will cost $1 USD based on testing but again this can vary widely by complexity.
