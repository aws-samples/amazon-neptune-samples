Execute the generate_use_case function in `step_workflows.generate_usecase_from_topic.py`. Prompt the user to supply the use_case_topic parameter as a string. 
After it executes, ask the user if they would like to modify the file to better meet their requirements.
Remember the path of the output file as it will be required for the next step.
After it is updated (or they choose not to), suggest running the `@generate-model` prompt.
