    "Now that you learned how perform a single inference call you can go ahead and perform multiple end-to-end inference requests to measure response latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated, an end-to-end inference call for a node that already exists in the graph will have 3 distinct stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Graph sampling from Neptune DB.\n",
    "    * For a given target node that already exists in the graph, retrieve its k-hop neighborhood with a fanout limit, i.e. limiting the number of neighbors retrieved at each hop by a threshold.\n",
    "2. Payload preparation for inference\n",
    "    * Neptune DB returns graphs using [GraphSON](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.7.4/dev/io/#graphson), a specialized JSON-like data format used to describe graph data. At this step we need to convert the returned GraphSON to GraphStorm’s ownJSON spec. This step is performed on the inference client, in this case a SageMaker notebook instance.\n",
    "3. Model inference via SageMaker endpoint\n",
    "    * Once the payload is prepared, we send an inference request to a SageMaker endpoint that has loaded a previously trained model snapshot. The endpoint receives the request, performs any feature transformations needed (e.g. converting categorical features to one-hot encoding), creates the binary graph representation in memory and makes a prediction for the target node using the graph neighborhood and trained model weights. The response is encoded to JSON and sent back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude this investigation you will perform a series of inference calls for a random set of target nodes, measuring the latency of each stage and the total end-to-end latency. This should give you an indicate of what sort of latencies to expect for within-VPC inference.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrated how you can perform end-to-end online inference of graph neural networks, using a GraphStorm-trained model deployed as a SageMaker Inference Endpoint, using Neptune Database as the source of your graph data. In summary you learned the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to use the Gremlin query language perform k-hop ego-network sampling that is consistent with how GNN models are trained.\n",
    "2. How the responses coming from a Gremlin query look like, and how to transform those to the specification that GraphStorm expects for online inference.\n",
    "3. How to use boto3 to send an inference request to a SageMaker real-time endpoint.\n",
    "4. How to measure latency for end-to-end GNN inference calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphStorm and Neptune provide a unique combination that allows you to perform GNN inference online while maintaining full control of your model and graph source in-house.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this solution we demonstrated how to post inference calls from a client (in this case a SageMaker Notebook instance) that resides inside the same VPC as the Neptune DB cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your inference calls will come from external entities, e.g. a customer hitting a REST API on a different VPC, you will need to determine what's the best way for the inference client to access the Neptune cluster, e.g. using a [VPC peering connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/get-started-connect-ec2-other-vpc.html)."

    "## Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "To clean up all the resources created for this project you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Delete the SageMaker endpoint once you are done testing\n",
    "\n",
    "First, to delete the endpoint you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a low-level SageMaker service client.\n",
    "sagemaker_client = boto3.client('sagemaker', region_name=config_obj.aws_region)\n",
    "# Delete endpoint\n",
    "sagemaker_client.delete_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [SageMaker documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-delete-resources.html) on more options to delete an endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to delete the endpoint **before** running `cdk destroy`, otherwise\n",
    "`cdk destroy` might fail. The reason is that the endpoint is using a network interface\n",
    "within the VPC, so we can't destroy the VPC before all network interfaces attached\n",
    "to it are deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Destroy the CloudFormation stack deployed through CDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**After deleting all deployed endpoints**, to destroy the CDK project you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate to the CDK project where you initially deployed it\n",
    "cd neptune-db-cdk\n",
    "# Make sure to provide any context variables if used\n",
    "cdk destroy # [--context prefix=dev-]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [CDK docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/ref-cli-cmd-destroy.html) on how to use `cdk destroy`, or the CloudFormation docs on how to [delete a stack from the console UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. [Optional] Empty and destroy the S3 bucket that holds the data model artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can [follow the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/delete-bucket.html) to empty and delete the S3 bucket the CDK has created.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the bucket in name the file `cdk_outputs.json`"
