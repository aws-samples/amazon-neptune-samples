## Customer Stories

### Audible for Business
> "A graph database gives us more flexibility than the relational systems. We might need to do a lot of joins on our tables [in a relational model], and that would have caused high latency of a lot of our business logic. A graph database is optimized for our use case. Amazon Neptune solved what we were trying to solve."
> 
> *Mayank Gupta, Software Engineer - Audible for Business*

### Siemens
metaphactory and Amazon Neptune enabled Siemens Energy to build a Turbine Knowledge Graph and visualize the connections between similar parts across the entire fleet of gas turbines. Amazon Neptune fits perfectly into the cloud-first strategy driven by Siemens Energy IT.

### Zerobase
> "We chose Neptune because it is a powerful graph database that is secure, performant, and analytics-friendly. In our [contact tracing] model, each user node is connected to a device node. Neptune allows us to store these rich relationships between users, check-ins, and locations to derive insight about the spread of the virus."
> 
> *Aron Szanto, Co-Founder - Zerobase*

### ADP
> "We like app-level encryption in addition to database-level encryption. When we use Amazon Neptune, the data is already encrypted before it gets to the database, and then it's encrypted again at rest."
> 
> *Zaid Masud, Chief Architect, ADP's next gen HCM*

### Zeta Global
> "By leveraging [Amazon] Neptune and other AWS services, we are able to achieve a cost-efficient data platform, at scale, in a very short period of time."
> 
> *Sasikala Singamaneni, Software Engineering Manager - Zeta Global*
